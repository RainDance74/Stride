# Welcome to Stride! ü•æ

Stride is a todo application built using ASP.NET Core for the backend and React for the frontend. To explore the entire repository and potentially build it yourself, head over to this repository: [github.com/nayvok-raindance/Stride](https://github.com/nayvok-raindance/Stride).

# How do I build it? üíª

The easiest way to build Stride is with Docker. Simply run `docker compose up` to build the application. However, this won't display anything on your local machine.

To access the backend and Swagger UI from your local PC, follow these instructions:

**Linux & macOS:**

    export HTTP_PORT=your_port
    export HTTPS_PORT=your_port
    docker compose up

**Windows (CMD):**

    set HTTP_PORT=your_port
    set HTTPS_PORT=your_port
    docker compose up

**Windows (PowerShell):**

    $env:HTTP_PORT="your_port"
    $env:HTTP_PORT="your_port"
    docker compose up

**Without Docker:**

If you don't have Docker installed, you can still run Stride. Set your connection string to your PostgreSQL database as an environment variable named `ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection`, either for your user or your entire computer. Then, with .NET 8.0 installed, run the application from the root repository directory using `dotnet run src/Web/Web.csproj`. The exposed port will be shown in the output, starting with `info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[14]`.

**Example output:**

    info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[14]
      Now listening on: http://localhost:5432

That's all you need to get started with Stride!

## Stride under the hood: üöò

- **Built with muscle:** Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture principles keep things organized and flexible, like a well-equipped gym where every piece of equipment has its place and purpose.
- **Monolithic but mighty:** Sure, it's not a microservices dance party, but Stride's one-piece design delivers seamless performance and consistency.
- **Tech symphony:** NSwag conducts the API orchestra, PostgreSQL and Asp.Identity keep the data vault secure, and MediatoR acts as the baton, ensuring smooth communication between frontend and backend.
